    "readme_description": "You are given an image represented by an `m x n` grid of integers `image`, where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. Your task is to perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.\n\nTo perform a **flood fill**:\n\n1. Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to `color`.\n2. Perform the same process for each pixel that is **directly adjacent** (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the **same color** as the starting pixel.\n3. Keep **repeating** this process by checking neighboring pixels of the *updated* pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.\n4. The process **stops** when there are **no more** adjacent pixels of the original color to update.\n\nReturn the **modified** image after performing the flood fill.",

Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel."
