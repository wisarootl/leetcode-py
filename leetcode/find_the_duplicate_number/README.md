**LeetCode:** [Problem 287](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
