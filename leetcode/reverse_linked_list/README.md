**Tags:** grind-75

**LeetCode:** [Problem 206](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
