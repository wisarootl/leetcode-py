# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

**LeetCode:** [Problem 33](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

## Problem Description

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly left rotated** at an unknown index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by 3 indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
