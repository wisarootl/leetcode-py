**LeetCode:** [Problem 104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
