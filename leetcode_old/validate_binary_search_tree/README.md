**LeetCode:** [Problem 98](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
```

**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
