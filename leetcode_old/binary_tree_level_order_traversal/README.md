## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
