This document provides detailed instructions for using LLM assistants to generate new problems with proper templates, test cases, and documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All GitHub Actions CI checks must pass (includes linting, testing, security scanning, reproducibility verification, and minimum 10 test cases per problem)
- Proper type hints and code formatting
- Complete the solution (documentation is auto-generated)

### 2. Other Contributions

All other contributions are welcome! This includes:

- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Helper class improvements
- CI/CD workflow enhancements
- Test case enhancements
- New data structure visualizations

**For small changes:** Feel free to open a pull request directly.

I'm also open to feedback and suggestions for improving the project!
